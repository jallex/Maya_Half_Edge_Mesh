# Maya_Half_Edge_Mesh
An implementation of the half edge mesh data structure in Maya using maya.api.OpenMaya (Python API 2.0). 

Behind the scenes, Maya uses the half edge mesh data structure for heavy computations such as decimation. This is a working example of half-edge meshes in Maya and a research project to explore new progressive mesh methods and algorithms, comparing these new methods with Maya's existing algorithms. 

# How to Use
1. Download script or paste it into Maya's script editor
2. Run script
3. Convert between Half-edge mesh data structures and Maya mesh objects in Maya's 3D editor
